## Hi there, I'm Francesco ðŸ‘‹


I'm a fervid Data Science student enthusiastic about Statistics, Mathematics, Programming, all Machine Learning's flavours and in Classical Music. You can find me on [![Linkedin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-blue?style=flat&logo=Linkedin&logoColor=white)](http://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-ferretto-at-ds)

## Here some of my projects 

- **Keyword-Spotting-Recognition-through-state-of-art-neural-architectures** [Repo](https://github.com/francescoferretto/Keyword-Spotting-Recognition-through-state-of-art-neural-architectures)

        The project focuses on models for speech recognition of a pre-defined set of keywords (Automatic Speech Recognition System) - Under Development.  

- **Investigating-relationships-between-Twitter-latent-topics-and-political-orientation** [Repo](https://github.com/francescoferretto/Investigating-relationships-between-Twitter-latent-topics-and-political-orientation)

        The aim of this project is, after a preliminary phase of manual data collection and labeling, in finding topics by analysing the cluster of tweets' words from people having different political parties. Two approaches where adopted for topic recognition:
        - a syntactic approach (TF-IDF index) and
        - a semantic one (with Doc2Vec).
        To detect clusters of words (topics) the k-means algorithm was used (under the assumption of non-overlapping clusters of words) and applied w.r.t. time in order to analyse the progress. 

- **Analysis-of-Rain-Behaviour-in-Australia** [Repo](https://github.com/francescoferretto/Analysis-of-Rain-Behaviour-in-Australia)

        The project analyses 140'000 daily meteorological measurements of 24 variables from 49 different Australian cities between the 2008 and 2017. One approach is to adapt a multiple linear regression model to the meteorological conditions (pressure, air direction, irradiation, ...) on day i wrt the quantity of fallen rain of day i+1, to overcome serious residuals' correlation the Cochrane-Orcutt procedure was applied. Another approach is to predict whether it could rain or not using logistic regression combined with dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g. PCA). 

- **Community-Detection-Graph-Optimization-Methods-based-on-Modularity-and-Balanced-Cuts** [Repo](https://github.com/francescoferretto/Community-Detection-Graph-Optimization-Methods-based-on-Modularity-and-Balanced-Cuts)

        Optimization project that tackles the problem of community detection through:
        - a Modularity based approach
        - a Graph Cut based approach
        applied on the General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology collaboration network dataset, and other 3 from SNAP.
        The first optimization problem was faced with the usage of the FAST-ATVO algorithm, a software for community detection in undirected graphs with non-negative weights. The second one was addressed through Radio DCA and Fista.

- **MLProjectDS-2020** [Repo](https://github.com/francescoferretto/MLProjectDS-2020)

        In this work we explain, discuss and solve an image
        recognition problem in Machine Learning in a different
        number of ways. We start with simpler methods like Logistic
        Regression or k-NN, then made some experiments with decision
        trees and random forests and finally use some more
        complex models like Support Vector Machines and Convolutional
        Neural Networks. We also report our results, and
        try to explain and interpret them. All the presented models
        were implemented using scikit-learn and keras
        modules for Python.

- **Biological-Data-Project-Characterization-of-the-Phosphomethylpyrimidine-kinase-protein-domain**

            This project is about the characterization of
            a single protein domain. As starting point,
            each group is provided with a representative
            domain sequence and the corresponding Pfam
            identifier. The objective of the first part of
            the project is to build a sequence model starting
            from the assigned sequence. In the second
            part, the actual domain family characterization is
            performed analyzing different aspects: structure,
            taxonomy and functions. Along with a PDF
            report, each group is asked to submit domain
            models, code, commands and generated data as
            supplementary material.
